# Project
**Pipeline for the analysis of ketamine and psilocybin power spectral density**

**Author:** Milad Soltanzadeh
**Supervisor:** Dr. Andreea Diaconescu 

# Steps:
1. Application of fooof model on the power spectral density (PSD) of EEG signals recorded during mismatch negativity
2. Statistical analysis of group differences using partial least square (PLS)
3. Analysis of correlation between PSD features altered state of questionnaire
